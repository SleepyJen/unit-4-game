First, click the start button to generate a number between 0 and 100. 
Under all the crystals are hidden numbers every time the start button is clicked. 

The goal of the game is to reach the targeted number using the crystals provided each time the game starts.
Once the end game is reached, restart the project and then click the start button again.
Have Fun!
